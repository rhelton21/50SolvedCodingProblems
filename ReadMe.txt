Explanation: we can get 30 by taking the elements at index 0 (value: 20, weight: 6) and index 3 (value: 10, weight: 3), the sum of weights is 9kg, it doesn't exceed the maxWeight
ShortestPalindrome----------------------------------------------------
Given a string str, create a function that returns the shortest palindrome that we can get by adding characters in front of str. Note that a palindrome is a string that can be read in the same way from the left and from the right.
Example 1:
Input: str = "acbcabcbb"
Output: "bbcbacbcabcbb"
Example 2:
Input: str = "bcaacb"
Output: "bcaacb"
Example 3:
Input: str = "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
CoinChange-------------------------------------------------------------
Given an amount of money, and a set of possible coins, create a function that returns the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. Note that if there exists no combination to do so, the function must return -1.
Example 1:
Input: amount = 15, coins = {2, 3, 7}
Output: 4
Explanation: we can make 15 by taking a coin of value 7, two coins of value 3, a coin of value 2.
Example 2:
Input: amount = 34, coins = {5, 13}
Output: -1
Explanation: there is no combination of coins to make 34.
WordSearch------------------------------------------------------------
Given a board of characters and a string word, create a boolean function that checks if we can find the word in the board. Note that the word must be made with adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical neighbours), and that the same cell can be used only once.
Example 1:
Input: board = [['K','I','N','T'], ['B','I','N','S'], ['G','N','Y','I'], ['U','O','E','D'], ['D','I','B','V'], ['H','I','R','T']], word = "INSIDE"
Output: true
NQueens---------------------------------------------------------------
Given a positive integer n, create a function that returns the number of possible ways to put n queens in an n*n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Note that two queens attack each other when they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
WordLadder------------------------------------------------------------
Given two words beginWord and endWord, and a list of words wordList, create a function that returns the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord.
Note that:
-Only one letter can be changed at a time.
-Each intermediate word in the sequence must be in the wordList.
-The function returns 0 if there is no possible transformation sequence.
-All words have the same length.
-All words contain lowercase alphabetic characters.
-There are no duplicates in the wordList.
-beginWord and endWord are non-empty, and they are different.
Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: one short possible transformation sequence is: "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
Output: 0
Explanation: there is no way to go from "hit" to "cog"
LongestIncSeq----------------------------------------------------------
Given an array of integers arr, create a function that returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Note that elements of that sequence must be strictly increasing and are not obliged to be contiguous.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [9, 5, 1, 8, 6, 3, 0, 15, 5, 12, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: the longest increasing subsequence is 1 3 5 12, its length is 4
Example 2:
Input: arr = [7, 5, 2, 4, 7, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 12, 1, 7]
Output: 5
Explanation: the longest increasing subsequence is 2 3 4 5 12, its length is 5
Example 3:
Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 1
Explanation: the subsequence must be strictly increasing, so the longest one here is 5, its length is 1
